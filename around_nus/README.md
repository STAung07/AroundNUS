## Proposed Level of Achievement

## Motivation
NUS students, including us, often find themselves having to use various platforms in the process of trying to get from one place to another in school. From using NUS Next Bus to first determine the bus to bring them to the nearest bus stop, then using google maps to find a way to walk to the building from the bus stop to the destination building. If they are unsure of the location of the room / lecture theatre, NUSMODS will then be employed to figure out where the room is before the student can get there. This is an extremely time consuming and inefficient process which we aim to solve through our app.

## Aim
Provide an all in one navigation app for NUS students to find their way around campus efficiently without having to cross - reference from different apps or websites 

## Scope of Project

The navigation screen will provide a map interface for users to pinpoint their current location, as well as a search feature that will allow them to locate places and amenities in NUS.

The bus screen will provide bus timings of busses that are available at the bus stop they are currently at.

Finally, the most important directions feature will allow users to input their starting and ending location and the app will provide detailed directions on the shortest path to get there.

Development Plan up to next Milestone:

By Mid June:
1. Search feature will suggest recent features searched by users; autocomplete feature
2. Users able to save frequent / favourite destinations in Directions Screen

By End June:
1. Path finding algorithm improved to locate specific tutorial rooms / lecture theatres / amenities 
2. Multiple path options: Walking, Bus, Drive
